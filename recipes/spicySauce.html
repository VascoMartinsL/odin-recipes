                This is based on the sauce I learned from my grandma. She likes spicy things. Hey, Sicilians living in Texas-we're down with spice. Think of it like an <em>arrabbiata</em> sauce but nobody's angry.

            <ul>
                <li>794g whole peeled tomatoes, drained</li>
                <li>4g kosher salt</li>
                <li>110g extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>40g onion, <strong>thinly sliced</strong></li>
                <li>30g garlic</li>
                <li>8g dried Calabrian chiles</li>

            </ul>

            </div>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Put the tomatoes in a large bow. Using your hand, crush each tomato into walnut-sized pieces. Season with salt and 55g of the olive oil.
                    Mix thoroughly and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>In a medium saute pan, heat the remaining 55g oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until it begins to brown, about 10 minutes.
                    Add the garlic and cook for an additional 2 minutes, or until the garlic is soft.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the fresh Calabrian chiles and continue to cook. Raise the heat to high, add the tomatoes, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring vigorously.
                    Add a bit more olive oil if the mixture begins sticking.
                </li>
                <li>Add the basil, taste, and adjust the seasoning. Transfer to a container, cool, and refrigerate until ready to use. Use in first 2 days or freeze.</li>
