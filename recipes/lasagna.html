    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>
        Lasagne is the perfect comfort food dish and is just at home on the Sunday lunch table as it is as the centerpiece 
        of a dinner party with friends. What makes it so versatile is the fact that it can be made well in 
        advance and baked when required - perfect for stress free hosting!
    </p>
    <p>
        An authentic lasagne is made with the famous ragyu Bolognese and egg pasta sheets typical of the Emilia-Romagna region, 
        although dried pasta sheets can be used instead thanks to their ready availability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Layers are built up using the pasta sheets, ragyu and bechamel (white) sauce, 
        all topped with a final layer of the sauce and a sprinkling of grated parmesan cheese.

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Start by preparing the Ragyu Bolognese:
            <ol>
               <li>
                Heat the extra virgin olive oil and butter in a pan, add the onion, celery, carrot and pancetta and sweat on a gentle heat for about 10 minutes until the onion has softened.   
                
               </li> 
               <li>Add the meat and brown all over.</li>
               <li>Increase the heat, add the wine and allow to evaporate.</li>
               <li>Dilute the tomato puree in a little of the stock and stir into the meat.</li>
               <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and cook on a gentle heat for 2 hours, checking and adding a little extra stock from time to time to avoid the sauce from drying out.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Once the Bolognese has rested for at least 2 more hours, preheat the oven at 200 degrees Celcius</li>
        <li>
            Start making the Bechamel sauce:
            <ol>
                <li>Melt the butter in a small pan on a medium heat, remove from the heat, stir in the flour with a small hand whisk (this will avoid lumps from forming) until you get a paste, stir in a little milk.</li>
                <li>Return to the heat, add the remaining milk and stirring all the time.</li>
                <li>Cook on a medium heat for about 3 to 4 minutes until the sauce begins to thicken.</li>
                <li>Remove from the heat, season with salt & pepper and stir in about a third of the grated parmesan.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Line an ovenproof dish with a little of the Bolognese sauce, arrange sheets of lasagne over followed by more sauce, then a layer of white sauce, sprinkle some grated parmesan and continue making layers like this until you have used up all the ingredients ending with a topping of white sauce and grated parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the hot oven for about 30 - 35 minutes until golden-brown.  Remove, leave to rest for a couple of minutes and serve.</li>
    </ol>
