                Lasagne is the perfect comfort food dish and is just at home on the Sunday lunch table as it is as the centerpiece 
                of a dinner party with friends. What makes it so versatile is the fact that it can be made well in 
                advance and baked when required - perfect for stress free hosting!

                An authentic lasagne is made with the famous ragyu Bolognese and egg pasta sheets typical of the Emilia-Romagna region, 
                although dried pasta sheets can be used instead thanks to their ready availability.

                Layers are built up using the pasta sheets, ragyu and bechamel (white) sauce, 
                all topped with a final layer of the sauce and a sprinkling of grated parmesan cheese.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Heat the extra virgin olive oil and butter in a pan, add the onion, celery, 
                    carrot and pancetta and sweat on a gentle heat for about 10 minutes until the onion has softened.
                </li> 
                <li>Add the meat and brown all over.</li>
                <li>Increase the heat, add the wine and allow to evaporate.</li>
                <li>Dilute the tomato puree in a little of the stock and stir into the meat.</li>
                <li>
                    Reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and cook on a gentle heat for 2 hours, 
                    checking and adding a little extra stock from time to time to avoid the sauce from drying out.
                </li>
                <li>Once the Bolognese has rested for at least 2 more hours, preheat the oven at 200 degrees Celcius</li>
                <li>
                    Melt the butter in a small pan on a medium heat, remove from the heat, 
                    stir in the flour with a small hand whisk (this will avoid lumps from forming) until you get a paste, stir in a little milk.
                </li>
                <li>Return to the heat, add the remaining milk and stirring all the time.</li>
                <li>Cook on a medium heat for about 3 to 4 minutes until the sauce begins to thicken.</li>
                <li>Remove from the heat, season with salt & pepper and stir in about a third of the grated parmesan.</li>
                <li>Line an ovenproof dish with a little of the Bolognese sauce, arrange sheets of lasagne over followed by more sauce, 
                    then a layer of white sauce, sprinkle some grated parmesan and continue making 
                    layers like this until you have used up all the ingredients ending with a topping of white sauce and grated parmesan cheese.
                </li>
                <li>Bake in the hot oven for about 30 - 35 minutes until golden-brown.  Remove, leave to rest for a couple of minutes and serve.</li>
