    <p>
        Lasagne is the perfect comfort food dish and is just at home on the Sunday lunch table as it is as the centerpiece 
        of a dinner party with friends. What makes it so versatile is the fact that it can be made well in 
        advance and baked when required - perfect for stress free hosting!
    </p>
    <p>
        An authentic lasagne is made with the famous ragyu Bolognese and egg pasta sheets typical of the Emilia-Romagna region, 
        although dried pasta sheets can be used instead thanks to their ready availability.

        Layers are built up using the pasta sheets, ragyu and bechamel (white) sauce, 
        all topped with a final layer of the sauce and a sprinkling of grated parmesan cheese.
